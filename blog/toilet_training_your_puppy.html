          <h2 class="grey">Toilet Training Your Puppy</h2>
            <p class="grey">You’ve just welcomed a new bundle of fluff into your family. Congratulations! These are exciting times, and the start of a lifetime of friendship and love. It is easy to get caught up in the cuteness - but it is important to also get your puppy started on toilet training - consistently and early.</p>
            <p class="grey">Accidents are no fun to clean up - so toilet training your puppy will make both of your lives much better.</p>
            <h3 class="grey">When should I start toilet training my puppy?</h3>
            <p class="grey">You should start toilet training your puppy immediately.</p>
            <p class="grey">Once you welcome him/her into your home, you should start to actively toilet train. Between the ages of 8 - 17 weeks is the ideal time to potty train.</p>
            <h3 class="grey">What are the benefits of toilet training?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="grey">No little accidents to clean up</li>
                <li class="grey">Your home will smell fresh and will be clean and hygienic</li>
                <li class="grey">Your puppy can enjoy more freedom around the home</li>
                <li class="grey">Your puppy can visit other people's houses without the risk of ruining their carpets</li>
                <li class="grey">Your puppy will be happier - they hate being scolded when they have accidents</li>
                <li class="grey">Your puppy won’t soil in their crate/bed or in the car</li>
                <li class="grey">It will save you money - no more buying puppy pads and cleaning supplies or replacement rugs and carpets.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="grey">What do I need to begin toilet training?</h3>
            <p class="grey">You will need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="grey">Puppy training pads</li>
                <li class="grey">A Swoopet Pooper Scooper</li>
                <li class="grey">A crate</li>
                <li class="grey">Cleaning supplies and rubber gloves (for any mishaps along the way!)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="grey">How to reward good behaviour / no accidents?</h3>
            <p class="grey">Praise is the key here! If your puppy avoids having an accident, be sure to give him lots of praise. Your pup will associate good behaviour with rewards and will strive to please you. Your vocal praise, love and belly rubs is all you need - no treats necessary.</p>
            <h3 class="grey">How to: Puppy Toilet Training</h3>
            <p class="grey">If you have a garden, the goal is to train your puppy to use it as their bathroom.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="grey">Choose a designated toilet area in your back garden.</li>
                <li class="grey">Set regular feedings times and keep an eye on when your puppy drinks and how much it drinks. This will give you a clue as to when it may need to ‘use the potty’.</li>
                <li class="grey">Every half hour to an hour bring your puppy outside to see if it needs to go. Always take your puppy outside after eating and playing too.</li>
                <li class="grey">While outside place your puppy in the designated toilet area and say ‘go to the toilet’. Do not play with it when on a toilet break. If it does go to the toilet while outside be sure to praise it and give it lots of belly rubs. Always reward good behaviour!</li>
                <li class="grey">Once they have gone to the toilet, bring them back inside and repeat this exercise again after 30-60 minutes.</li>
                <li class="grey">If your puppy is about to have an accident indoors, say ‘No’ sternly and carry them to the back garden (if possible). If they then go outside, praise them for their good behaviour.</li>
                <li class="grey">At night time give your puppy a designated sleeping area (ideally a crate) - this will give them a small space to sleep in and will discourage them from soiling it, you will be able to hear them cry and can take them outside for a toilet break, you will avoid having to find and clean up accidents around the home.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="grey">Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="grey">If you need to leave your puppy home alone for a half hour or so either leave them in their crate with their bed and a puppy pad or leave them in a room with a puppy pad for any accidents.</li>
                <li class="grey">Before you leave the house be sure to take your puppy outside a few times to allow it to use the toilet and avoid any accidents while you are away.</li>
                <li class="grey">If your puppy has an accident indoors - DO NOT rub their nose in it, DO NOt shout or scare them and DO NOT discipline them when it has already occurred.</li>
                <li class="grey">If your puppy has an accident indoors - let them know it was wrong by using your disappointed voice and clean up the mess without making a big deal about it.</li>
                <li class="grey">Be patient - it will be worth it in the end!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="grey">House Training Your Adult Dog</h2>
            <p class="grey">You’ve just welcomed a new bundle of fluff into your family. Congratulations! These are exciting times and the start of a lifetime of friendship and love. When adopting an older dog they may not be house trained and so this may be a task you need to undertake. Many rescue centres will already have undertaken this task and it will be up to you to continue reinforcing it. It requires a lot of patience but it will make both of your lives much better.</p>
            <h3 class="grey">When should I start house training my dog?</h3>
            <p class="grey">If house training hasn’t already begun we would recommend you to start house training your new dog immediately. Note that even house trained dogs can have accidents when they move into a new home. Give them a few days grace but always reinforce the idea that the garden is for toilet breaks - reward good behaviour.</p>
            <h3 class="grey">What are the benefits of house training?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="grey">No accidents to clean up</li>
                <li class="grey">Your home will smell fresh and will be clean and hygienic</li>
                <li class="grey">Your dog can enjoy more freedom around the home</li>

            <p class="grey">If you have a garden, the goal is to train your dog to use it as their bathroom.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="grey">Choose a designated toilet area in your back garden and leave soiled newspaper or faeces here so your dog associates there as it’s toilet. Once your dog is trained you can remove these and keep the area clean.</li>
                <li class="grey">Set regular feedings times and keep an eye on when your dog drinks and how much it drinks. This will give you a clue as to when it may need ‘to go’.</li>
                <li class="grey">Every morning, last thing at night and every hour during the day bring your dog outside to see if it needs to go. Always take your dog outside after eating, when it wakes up and after playing too.</li>
                <li class="grey">While outside place your dog in the designated toilet area and say ‘go to the toilet’. Do not play with it when on a toilet break. If it does go to the toilet while outside be sure to praise it. Always reward good behaviour!</li>

            <ul>
                <li class="grey">Signs your dog needs to go to the toilet: circling/pacing, sniffing the floor, looking restless, crying or whining, standing at the door.</li>
                <li class="grey">If you need to leave your dog home alone for an hour or so either leave them in their crate with their bed and a puppy pad or leave them in a room with a puppy pad for any accidents.</li>
